# Subscriptions

## About

__Add a simple contact form to Refinery that notifies you and the customer when an subscription is made.__

In summary you can:

* Collect and manage subscriptions
* Specify who is notified when a new subscription comes in
* Customise an auto responder email that is sent to the person making the subscription
* Export a CSV file of all the subscriptions

When subscriptions come in, you and the customer are notified. The subscription will now show up as an "open" subscription. The idea is to deal with the subscription and then "close" it so you know it's been sorted.

## How do I get Notified?

Go into your 'Subscriptions' tab in the Refinery admin area and click on "Update who gets notified"

## How do I Edit the Automatic Confirmation Email

Go into your 'Subscriptions' tab in the Refinery admin area and click on "Edit confirmation email"
